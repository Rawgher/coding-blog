#### Work

Right now we have a few big projects going on. Our major conference is in two weeks so we're finalizing all the materials and assets for that. We're also building out one new site and revamping another. I'm personally mostly working on the new site while my lead dev works on the old site revamp. I did start that project previously but there was a long pause on it that made more sense for him to start working on it. We've found out that both of these projects are expected to be done or at least have a ton of progress on them before the conference even though we're lacking assests and the designs/copy isn't finalized.

#### Side Projects

I've mostly been continuing to work on the 100 days of code challenge (I'm through day 19 now), and my react ecommerce site build. I was also working on my technical interview skills and big O notation a few weeks ago but I haven't gotten back into it yet. I'm hoping that next week I'll get back on that so I can keep improving my skills.

#### Current Life Updates

We've been working with our planner more and have a cake/dessert tasting scheduled at the end of the month. We're on the fence about whether to have cake for everyone or do some cake and then have a dessert bar so that people have options. We've also got a meeting scheduled with the planner for next week to go over some of the designs and themes of the wedding.

#### Karate

No major updates here. I've mostly gotten my testing kata down but could definitely work on being more consistant with my stances. I feel like my legs are getting stronger so it's not as hard to move and get into the proper position when we're moving slowly, but I find myself either overstepping or understepping during some of my moves when going quickly. I also need to work on my kicks and hip movement. My front kicks are great and I can kick pretty high now, but my roundhouse is trash. There's something weird with how my hip moves during it that is making it harder to do.
