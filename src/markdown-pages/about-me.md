### A bit about me:

My name is Roger and I currently work as a web developer. I'm making this blog to try to keep better track of what I've been doing at work for the week, what types of side projects/learning I've been doing to improve my coding skills, and how different current events/activities in my life are going. I'll be splitting most of my posts into these three major sections. I plan to keep working on this site to improve it's overall design and functionality, but for now I'll just do my best to keep up on writing my life updates.

#### Work

I currently build websites for a non-profit and their partner companies. We typically use HTML, CSS, Javascript/Jquery, PHP, and Wordpress as our database management/plugin manager. The frontend of all of our sites are fully custom and do not use the wordpress template builder.

#### Side Projects

I've been working on different React projects and a 100 days of code challenge. I originally learned the MERN stack when I did my boot camp (along with basic coding languages) but do not use this in my current job. I'm resolidifying my understanding of the MERN stack while trying to build projects that can be used on my protfolio website.

#### Current Life Updates

I'll be getting married in a few months. My fiance and I have taken care of the majority of the logistics ourselves but recently hired a wedding planner to help us find the last of our vendors. My wedding ring came the other day and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

#### Karate

I started going to a Shotokan karate dojo back in November. Since then I've gotten to my yellow belt. I really enjoy it and it is a great stress outlet/physical activity for me. I feel like I'm slowly improving (and plateauing) as the weeks go by but I definitely still have a lot to work on. I'm hoping to be able to test for my orange belt some time in April but that will all depend on what my sensei thinks.
