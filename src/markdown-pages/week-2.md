#### Work

We've had a few fire drills this week that all have to do with our big conference next week. Hopefully we've taken care of most of them because we won't have much time next week to take care of anything that is left over.

#### Side Projects

I wasn't able to work on this area as much as I would've liked this week given how many fire drills we had at work. I was able to come up with an idea of a react website I'd like to build though. I want to build something where I can start planning ideas for mine and my fiance's honeymoon. Ideally the site will have some fun things to do at each of the locations we've been floating out and maybe randomly pick one of them for us to go to.

#### Current Life Updates

Not too much going on here. We met with our planner and just went over some basic updates. We'll be working on our website and getting invites sent soonish. We also are getting more invovled in the overall design and layout of the wedding.

#### Karate

I tweaked my knee pretty badly this week so I had to take a day off. We have a joint workshop with a few of the Northern California dojos this weekend that I'm looking forward to attending. It'll be nice seeing how much everyone has improved since the last joint workshop we had in January.
